    "    - being able to GATHER good DATA is crucial,\n",
    "    - being able to PRE-PROCESS is another key ability which in turn allows us to do predictive modeling, ML and others. \n",

    "- Regression Analysis is a statistical approach used to estimate a relationship between a dependent variable or an OUTCOME and one or more independent vars or PREDICTORS.\n",
