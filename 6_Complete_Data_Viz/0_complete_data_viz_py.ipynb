    "1. People have biologically evolved to be visual creatures. Visualizing data truly helps ins business and DS in particular.\n",
    "    - Data Visualization is the field which enables people to \"see\" the number and the person who visualizes the data is the \"enabler\": help other see the numbers.\n",
    "2. Data an DS is a leading force in today's economy and:\n",
    "    - being able to GATHER good DATA is crucial,\n",
    "    - being able to PRE-PROCESS is another key ability which in turn allows us to do predictive modeling, ML and others. \n",
    "    - However, there is nothing more important than being able to interpret that Data.\n",
    "3. Data Visualization is the face of DS.\n",
    "4. Data Visualization is spectacular (not boring)\n",
    "- QUIZ: Why is Data Viz important?:\n",
    "    1. Humans process visual information better than raw numbers.\n",
    "    2. Data viz enables us to interpret the data\n",
    "    3. Data viz is the face of DS."

    "- Process of Data viz: 1. Gather Data (assume is preprocessed), 2. Choose the right visualization, 3. Visualize and style the data and label the chart.\n",
    "- Beginning with the mother of DS, Statistics: Types of Data and Level of Measurements, quite often these determine the chart we choose to plot. - One Framework: Statistics Data Type\n",
    "- Ex. Bar charts contains several bars or several categories (in x-axis), and there will be a numerical measure to show how high these bars will be.\n",
    "- Pie charts similar to bars charts, there are several cats and some numerical measure to show what portion of the pie is attributed to that cat.\n",
    "- Scatter plot: both axes show numerical values.\n",
    "- The statistical theory is extremely useful for Data viz: Course materials to complete theory.\n",
    "- Line chart: y-axis is numerical and x-axis is Date (Date could be consider numeric or categorical but the actual approach is in Time Series Analysis - Date and Datetime data type).\n",
    "- Other Framework: https://www.data-to-viz.com/. - Numeric, Categoric, Num & Cat, Maps, Network, Time Series.\n",
    "- There is never a single possible chart choice:\n",
    "    1. Stay away (you should never choose) from complex plots. Keep things simple.\n",
    "    2. Don't choose a chart that can ne misinterpreted (The goal of data viz is to help others understand the data not confuse them even further).\n",
    "    3. Don't stay away from rudiments.\n",
    "- Other Framework: https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/choosing-plot-types-and-custom-styles\n",

    "- QUIZ: Which is NOT a step in Data viz?\n",
    "    - Performing predictive analysis on the data (Gather data, Chossing the right viz and Chart stylein are)\n",
    "- QUIZ: When working with Time series data, what is the best way to represent the date?\n",

    "    - Color could be use in a chart to speak to you and to audience.\n",

    "> Using more than three colors in a chart is simple PROHIBITED.    \n",
    "3. Colors should be chosen carefully.\n",
    "    - Color Theory: Primary colors: r, b and y. Secondary colors: purple (r+b), green (b+y), orange (y+r). Then tertiary colors. All in the 'color wheel'.\n",
    "    - Also we have: Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Shade, Tint, Tone, Temperature and more...\n",
    "    - Computers don't generate colors based on r, b, y. Computers main color are RGB, Printers: CMYK\n",
    "- Practical cases:\n",
    "    1. The colors are predetermined. Quite often a company's colors dictate the styling of the data visualizations.\n",
    "    2. On-line tools that can help: ex. https://coolors.co/\n",
