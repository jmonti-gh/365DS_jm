## Basic on NN (Neural Networks)
- Each Neuron is defined using sggmoid function. The neurons (the sigmoid functions) are connected to each other to form a neural network --> The output of one layer is the input of the next layer <-- Forward Propagation.
- The final layer generates the Output or Prediction of the NN 
- Cost function (predicted value - truth value): how far our NN is from making its desired predictions.
- Obj.: minimize the value of Cost func. --> an algorithm wihich can update the values of the parameters in the NN in such a way that the cost func. achieves its minimum value.
- Algorithms such as gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent are used to update the parameters of the neural network
